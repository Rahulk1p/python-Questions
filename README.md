<b>1. Add two numbers as a linked list</b>
<br><b>Description:</b> You are given two linked-lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.<br>
      Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)<br>
      Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8<br>
      Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.<br>

<br><b>2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters length</b>
<br><b>Description:</b> Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
          For Example: Suppose this is the String 'abrkaabcdefghijjxxx'. Longest Palindrome string without repeating character is aabcdefghij and its length is 10.

<br><b>3. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards. Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.</b><br>
<b>Description:</b> Example:<br>
Input: "banana"<br>
Output: "anana"<br>

Input: "million"<br>
Output: "illi"<br>

<br><b>4 Imagine you are building a compiler. Before running any code, the compiler must check that the parentheses in the program are balanced. <BR>
         Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket. We can approximate this using strings.</b><br>
<b>Description:</b> Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
- Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example:
Input: "((()))"
Output: True

Input: "[()]{}"
Output: True

Input: "({[)]"
Output: False
